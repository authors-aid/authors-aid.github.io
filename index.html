        My name is Deborah Turner Harris. If you&#39;ve been drawn to this website, it&#39;s because you have something to communicate: a story to tell &#45; a thesis to document &#45; experiences to relate. That urge to communicate has made you a writer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every writer knows that writing is hard work. It demands considerable energy and dedication just to complete a first draft &#45; and that&#39;s only the beginning. Next looms the prospect of revision: the challenge to develop your work to its fullest
        potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Few writers trust themselves to critique their own work. Most would prefer to enlist the help of an editor &#45; ideally someone who combines the analytical skills of a critic with a personal understanding of the writer&#39;s craft.
      </p>
      <p>Which is where I come in.</p>

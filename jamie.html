              <p>
                I am a graduate from the University of Dundee with an Honours degree in English and Creative Writing.
                I have been accepted into the University&#39;s post-graduate Masters program where I will be working towards
                an M-Litt degree in Writing Practice and Study.
              </p>
              <p>
                My interest in writing goes right back to primary school and this interest has only grown throughout my time in education.
                For my Advanced Higher English grade I wrote my first folio of graded creative work. To hone my skills, I have participated
                in a number of online writing workshops such as <a href="http://www.webook.com" target="_blank">webook.com</a> and
                 <a href="http://www.wattpad.com" target="_blank">wattpad.com</a> and have become well known on the sites as
                a thorough and honest editor. I have since expanded my editorial experience to include working with more advanced writers, both
                electronically and in person, with fellow students of creative writing. In class I developed a bit of a reputation as the guy who
                was willing to be honest, and give good, hard, constructive feedback.
              </p>
              <p>
                This journey of editorial work has now culminated with the publication of The Billion Dollar Marriage Contract by Alyssa Urbano,
                the first published novel which I had the pleasure of editing in its entirety. It is available in hard-copy, on Amazon Kindle and
                 <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20611396-the-billion-dollar-marriage-contract.">Goodreads</a>
              </p>

              <p>
                So why me? To me, this is more than a job, it&#39;s a passion - the kind of thing I do instead of
                watching a film or playing a video game. With two published authors as parents, I am in a better
                position than most to appreciate just what it takes for a novel to really flourish. With the time I have
                spent refining my editorial approach online, I am in a perfect position to help budding writers take
                their work to the next level.

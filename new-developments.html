              <h2>Jamie Joins the Team
              <img src="images/JamieFront2.jpg" alt="" title="Jamie Harris" width="141" height="187" class="alignright"></h2>
              <p>Since its launch in 2012, Authors-Aid has attracted a growing number of clients. In view of this welcome increase, I am very pleased to announce that as of 15 April, I will be taking on my son Jamie Harris as an apprentice.</p>
              <p>Jamie has recently graduated from the University of Dundee with an Honours degree in English Language and Literature, with an emphasis on Creative Writing. This specialisation attests to his keen interest in writing and the mechanics of the writing process. </p>
              <p>While still in high school, he became actively involved in several on-line writers' groups, exchanging critiques with other novice writers. He has since compounded this experience mentoring more advanced writers within the university system. One of his most recent contacts has just secured a publishing contract on the strength of his editorial guidance.</p>
